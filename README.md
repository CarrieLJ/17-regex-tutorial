# 18-social-networking

## Description

This project is to demonstrate my skills on NoSQl, utilizing MongoDB. In doing so, I have created a NoSQl database that can be used as a social networking web application. I have learned how to build and structure the API. This web application can be used amongst friends to share thoughts, react to friend's thoughts, and create a friend list. Express.js was utilized when creating routing. 

## Installation

NA

## Usage

In order to utilize this web application on the back end, you will need to install npm. Once that has completed, start your npm and open up Insomnia. Once in Insomnia, you can start adding, getting all, getting by individual id, updating, or deleting the users, friends, thoughts, and reactions.
